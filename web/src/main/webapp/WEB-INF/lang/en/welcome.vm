  <h2>Online Monitoring Invasive Meningococcal Disease in Germany</h2>
  <p>
    <b>Detecting meningococcal disease outbreaks as early as possible is
    important in order to minimize the number of infections amongst the
    population. EpiScanGIS uses a Geographical Information System (GIS)
    to present maps showing the distribution of all cases of
    meningococcal disease, that have been registered at the
    <a href="http://www.meningococcus.de" target="_blank" class="newWindow">
      National Reference Centre for Meningococci (NRZM)</a> in Germany. 
    Thus it acts as early warning system, that provides you
    with easy to access and timely information on meningococcal diseases
    in Germany.</b><br />
