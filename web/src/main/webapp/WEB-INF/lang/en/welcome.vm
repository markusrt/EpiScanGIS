     We weren't able to test the compatibility of EpiScanGIS with all possible
     browser/operating system combinations prior to the launch. Especially the 
     use of the Internet Explorer may cause problems.

     By now, we carried out some changes, that should solve most of the difficulties.
     If the map browser isn't functioning, even after you have restarted your browser,
     then it would be nice if you sent me an e-mail including the Version and name of
     your browser and operating system respectively.

  <h2>Online Monitoring Invasive Meningococcal Disease in Germany</h2>
  <p>
    <b>Detecting meningococcal disease outbreaks as early as possible is
    important in order to minimize the number of infections amongst the
    population. EpiScanGIS uses a Geographical Information System (GIS)
    to present maps showing the distribution of all cases of
    meningococcal disease, that have been registered at the
    <a href="http://www.meningococcus.de" target="_blank" class="newWindow">
      National Reference Centre for Meningococci (NRZM)</a> in Germany. 
    Thus it acts as early warning system, that provides you
    with easy to access and timely information on meningococcal diseases
    in Germany.</b><br />
