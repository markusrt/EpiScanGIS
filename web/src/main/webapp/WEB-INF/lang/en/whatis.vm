      Detecting meningococcal disease outbreaks as early as possible is
      important in order to minimize the number of infections amongst
      the population. EpiScanGIS uses a Geographical Information System
      (GIS) to present maps showing the distribution of all cases of
      meningococcal disease, that have been registered at the
      <a href="http://www.meningococcus.de" target="_blank" class="newWindow">
        National Reference Centre for Meningococci (NRZM)</a>
      in Germany. Thus it acts as an information system, that provides
      you with easy to access and timely information on meningococcal
      infections in Germany.

    EpiScanGIS has been developed at the NRZM in cooperation with the
    <a href="http://www2.informatik.uni-wuerzburg.de" target="_blank" 
      class="newWindow">Chair of Computer Science II</a>
    and the company <a href="http://www.ridom.com" target="_blank"

    <h2>Monitoring Invasive Meningococcal Disease in Germany</h2>
    <p>
      One goal of this interdisciplinary project is, to provide a
      publicly accessible system for computer-aided epidemiological
      surveillance of meningococcal disease in Germany.
    </p>
    <p>
      EpiScanGIS provides you with weekly updated, dynamically
      generated maps. The underlying database is a result of the
      consistent work at the NRZM, which, as a national reference
      laboratory, types the majority of all meningococcal infections
      in Germany using microbiological methods.
    </p>
    <p>
      We used several non-commercial software components in this project, 
      that each apart accomplish bits in the overall process:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        The
        <a href="http://www.postgresql.org" target="_blank" class="newWindow">
          PostgreSQL</a>
        object-relational database stores anonymized epidemiological
        information.
      </li>
      <li>
        <a href="http://www.postgis.org" target="_blank" class="newWindow">
          PostGIS</a>
        adds support for geographic objects an queries to PostgreSQL.
      </li>
      <li>The
        <a href="http://mapserver.gis.umn.edu" target="_blank" class="newWindow">
          UMN Mapserver</a>
        is responsible for generating maps using the data provided by the
        database. 
      </li>
      <li>
        <a href="http://www.openlaszlo.org" target="_blank" class="newWindow">
          OpenLaszlo</a>
        is used to generate a Flash-based Rich Internet Application,
        that enable intuitive access to epidemiological data.

    <h2>Early Outbreak Detection</h2>
    <p>
      The second component of this online system provides the health community
      with an early warning cluster detection system.
    </p>
    <p>
      The resulting reports and maps are not publicly available, but they help 
      <a href="registerUser.vm">registered</a> and authorized public health 
      authorities in spotting possible risk areas and taking preventive measures.
    </p>
    <p>
      EpiScanGIS uses the Software
      <a href="http://www.satscan.org" target="_blank" class="newWindow">SaTScan™</a>
      for the 'cluster detection' process.
      The underlying dataset is automatically scanned on a weekly basis to
      detect potential diseases outbreaks in a timely manner.
    </p>

      SaTScan™ is a trademark of Martin Kulldorff. The SaTScan™ software was 
      developed under the joint auspices of Martin Kulldorff, of the National 
      Cancer Institute and of Farzad Mostashari at the New York City 
      Department of Health and Mental Hygiene.
